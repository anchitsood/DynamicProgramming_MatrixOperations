	Description: This project implements some operations on a matrix. Specifically, given a 4x4 matrix,
	it calculates its inverse and transpose.
	
	This project is implemented as a solution to a problem set. Detailed description of the problem
	is available in ProblemSet11.pdf. The implemented code is available in ps11.cpp.
	
	Code practices to note: Various classes have been used to build the solution. Note use of OOP
	practices for simplicity and reusability. Templated classes have been introduced. Further, note how
	the solution to the 3x3 problem is used	to build and solve the 4x4 problem. More generally, rudimentary
	ideas of dynamic programming have been introduced.
